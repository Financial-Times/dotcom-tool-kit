# @dotcom-tool-kit/create

This is an interactive script for migrating a repository to Tool Kit.

## Usage

You can start this script with `npm init`:

```sh
npm init @dotcom-tool-kit
```

It may prompt you to install this package. This works because of the `npm init` [naming convention](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/commands/npm-init).

The script requires at least a `package.json` to exist in your repository. If you don't have one, you can run `npm init` with no arguments first.

For a full explanation of what the script will do for you, see the [Migrating to Tool Kit guide](../../docs/migrating-to-tool-kit.md).
