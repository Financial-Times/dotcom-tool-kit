# @dotcom-tool-kit/npm

This plugin is for managing Tool Kit hooks that are run from npm scripts (such as `npm run test`).

This plugin will be installed as a dependency of the [frontend-app](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit/tree/main/plugins/frontend-app), [backend-heroku-app](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit/tree/main/plugins/backend-heroku-app), and [component](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit/tree/main/plugins/component) plugins so you do not need to install it separately if you are using either of those plugins.

## Installation

Install `@dotcom-tool-kit/npm` as a `devDependency` in your app:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dotcom-tool-kit/npm
```

Add the plugin to your [Tool Kit configuration](https://github.com/financial-times/dotcom-tool-kit/blob/main/readme.md#configuration):

```yaml
plugins:
	- '@dotcom-tool-kit/npm'
```
