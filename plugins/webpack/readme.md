# @dotcom-tool-kit/webpack

Tool Kit plugin to run [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org)

## Installation & usage

With Tool Kit [already set up](https://github.com/financial-times/dotcom-tool-kit#installing-and-using-tool-kit), install this plugin as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dotcom-tool-kit/webpack
```

And add it to your repo's `.toolkitrc.yml`:

```yml
plugins:
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/webpack'
```

### Building with Webpack locally

For local development, by default the `Webpack` task runs in `development` mode on the `build:local` command, and runs in `watch` mode on `run:local`. One plugin that provides these commands is [`npm`](../npm), allowing you to run Webpack with `npm run build` and `npm start`.

### Building with Webpack on CI and remote apps

The `Webpack` task runs in `production` mode on the `build:ci` command by default. `build:ci` is for compiling an app's source in CI jobs, and is provided by plugins like [`circleci`](../circleci/).

### Running on another command
You can also configure Webpack to run on any other command; for example, if you want to run it with `npm run test` via the `npm` plugin, you can manually configure Webpack to run on `npm`'s `test:local` command:

```yml
plugins:
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/webpack'
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/npm'
command:
  'test:local':
    Webpack:
      mode: development
```
