# @dotcom-tool-kit/commitlint

Tool Kit plugin to run [commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)

## Installation & Usage

With Tool Kit [already set up](https://github.com/financial-times/dotcom-tool-kit#installing-and-using-tool-kit), install this plugin as a dev dependency:

```sh
npm install --save-dev @dotcom-tool-kit/commitlint
```

And add it to your repo's `.toolkitrc.yml`:

```yml
plugins:
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/commitlint'
```

By default the plugin will run on the `git:commitmsg` command. There are no further configurations in Tool Kit, [use one of the config file locations that Commitlint supports](https://commitlint.js.org/reference/configuration).
