## Testing uploads using the review bucket

You can test uploads to S3 locally on your review bucket to check that you are happy with the configuration. To do this set your `NODE_ENV` to `branch`:

```bash
$ export NODE_ENV=branch
```

If the AWS key names for accessing the review bucket are different to the prod bucket then update those in the `.toolkitrc.yml`.

The `UploadAssetsToS3` task can run on any hook so you can configure it to run on a local hook to test deployment from the command line. For example, it could be added to your `build:local` hook as follows:

```yml
plugins:
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/webpack'
  - '@dotcom-tool-kit/upload-assets-to-s3'
hooks:
  'build:local':
    - WebpackDevelopment
    - UploadAssetsToS3
```

Then running `npm run build` will run the `UploadAssetsToS3` task on your review bucket.

## Tasks

| Name | Description | Preconfigured Hook|
|-|-|-|
| `UploadAssetsToS3` | Uploads provided files to a given S3 bucket | `release:remote` |
