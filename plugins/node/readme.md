# @dotcom-tool-kit/node

Run your Node application.

This plugin will be installed as a dependency of the [containerised-app-with-assets](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit/tree/main/plugins/containerised-app-with-assets), [containerised-app](https://github.com/Financial-Times/dotcom-tool-kit/tree/main/plugins/containerised-app) plugins so you do not need to install it separately if you are using either of those plugins.
